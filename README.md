FEATURES
--------

* Encrypt credit card information completely using the [encryption](https://www.drupal.org/project/encryption) module.
* 3DSecure payments are supported out of the box. The system checks if the bank is forcing for 3Dsecure payment method and then automatically handles the request. Otherwise it handles the process without the 3DSecure authentication.
* Turkish banks do not except foreign currency payments on Turkish cards, so the system checks if the card is Turkish first, if the product price currency is foreign, than it converts the price to TRY automatically via [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) API
* Sends all the cart data to Iyzico so later you can monitor your customer's behavior via Iyzico dashboard
* A Credit Card front-end library added [https://github.com/jessepollak/card](https://github.com/jessepollak/card) to make the look and feel better.
